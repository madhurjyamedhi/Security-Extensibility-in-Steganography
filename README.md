# Security-Extensibility-in-Steganography
This project addresses the security problem of transmitting the data over the internet network; the main idea behind this being how do we send a message secretly to a destination without it being detected by any third party intruder. This can be done using steganography which allows information to be hidden in digital carriers such as images, audio files, text files, videos and data transmissions.    This project aims to send a secret message by hiding it in a digital image file. The encryption and decryption is done using modified LSB algorithm combined with dna encryption for security extensibility.    On the receiver's end, a face recognition model is being used to authenticate the receiver adding yet another layer of security.
